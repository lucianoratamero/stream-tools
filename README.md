# stream-tools

this is a set of pages with effects that I use on my twitch streams. you don't need to redeploy the app, since they can be accessed on https://lucianoratamero.github.io/stream-tools/ and added to your OBS (or whatever you use) as a browser source.

they may work on any setup, as long as you follow the docs ;]

for more details on the pages and effects, visit our [docs page](https://lucianoratamero.github.io/stream-tools/docs/).

if you have any questions, just open an issue and I'll answer it when I can :)
